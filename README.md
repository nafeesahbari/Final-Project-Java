# Final-Project-Java

## Final Project Overview
- Presentation about experience with OOP & Spring/Spring Boot in the last 2 weeks.
- Include a project that used the 2nd language (what we learnt in these 2 weeks).
- ✅ Concert Booking System ✅
  - Use Java OOP and/or Spring Boot
  - For services of music concert dates. Implement user registration, booking creation, and payment processing using Spring Boot.
 
## Step 1: Set Up Development Environment
- Install JDK compatible with Spring Boot.
- Install an IDE: IntelliJ or Eclipse.
- Install Spring Boot: Use Spring Initializr to create a Spring Boot project with necessary dependencies.
  - [Spring Initializr](https://start.spring.io/)

## Step 2: Design Your System
- Identify/detrmine the core entities: Users, Concerts, Bookings, & Payments.
- Define relationships: Decide how these entities are related (e.g., a User can make multiple Bookings, a Concert can have multiple Bookings, etc.).
- Create a rough outline: Design the database tables and relationships needed to store data.

## Step 3: Implement User Registration
- Create a User entity: Define the User entity class with attributes like username, password, email, etc.
- Set up user registration API: Create endpoints for user registration, including validation and error handling.
- Implement user authentication: Use Spring Security to secure your application and handle user authentication.

## Step 4: Implement Booking Creation
- Create a Concert entity: Define the Concert entity class with attributes like concert name, date, venue, etc.
- Implement Concert management: Create APIs to manage concert data (e.g., list all concerts, get details of a specific concert, etc.).
- Create a Booking entity: Define the Booking entity class with attributes like user, concert, booking date, etc.
- Implement booking creation API: Create endpoints for users to book concert tickets, considering ticket availability and validation.

## Step 5: Implement Mock Payment Processing
- Create a Payment entity: Define a Payment entity class with attributes like payment amount, payment status, booking reference, etc.
- Implement payment API: Create an endpoint for users to simulate making a payment. When a user makes a booking, generate a mock payment record and associate it with the booking.

## Step 6: Test Your Application
- Write unit tests: Create unit tests for your controllers, services, and repositories to ensure that each component works as expected.
- Write integration tests: Test the interactions between different parts of your application, including user registration, booking creation, and payment processing.

## Step 7: Handle Security and Validation
- Implement input validation: Add validation to your APIs to prevent invalid or malicious data input.
- Handle authorization: Ensure that only authenticated users can access booking and payment APIs.

## Step 8: (Optional) User Interface
- Develop a user interface: Create a web-based or mobile front-end for your booking system to make it user-friendly.
- Integrate front-end with back-end: Connect your UI with the Spring Boot back-end using RESTful APIs.
